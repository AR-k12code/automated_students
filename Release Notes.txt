23.11.05
* Updated for ACOT 2023

21.04.14
* Added EnablePostProcessingScripts.ps1 to create/delete symbolic links for scripts included in the project.

* Migrated to using the sqlite binary to import the enrollments CSV. This takes seconds instead of minutes.
* QuickMode now evaluates Nickname if you use that to override First names in AD.
* If GAMPreCreateUser is specified then GAM should be enabled with the APIs requested for this project. Switch to send emails via the API instead of SMTP.

21.02.28
* Add updating the timestamp if we aren't uploading a new Teachers Passwords csv. This keeps backwards compatibility for the Drive Search "after:yesterday Student Passwords for"
* Added $StuPassforTeachersBuildings to settings.ps1 to control what buildings you want the student passwords shared to the teachers for.

* Duplicate EmployeeNumber check. Duplicate EmployeeNumbers can cause issues when searching for specific Student_ids.
* Additional Select-Object on CSV imports. This means we can modify the Cognos reports without breaking imports.
* Fixed timestamps in automated_sqlite.ps1 to be a Select-Obect expression instead of adding it.

21.02.20
